<p class="intro"> On this page I share information about my favorite city in Sweden.</p>

<p class="text">
In 2019, I moved to Stockholm from my hometown.
It was a big change in my life, but it became one of the best decisions I have ever made.
I lived there until the end of 2025, and during that time I learned a lot, made many new friends and created many good memories.
</p>

<p class="text">
One thing I love about Stockholm is how close nature is, even though you are in the city center.
You can walk by the water, you can visit parks, and enjoy beautiful views, all while being close to shops, schools, and workplaces.
This makes the city feel both calm and exciting at the same time.
</p>

<p class="text">
Stockholm also has a rich history and many interesting tourist attractions.
There are famous museums, old buildings, and cultural places to explore.
I especially enjoy visiting museums and learning more about Swedish history and culture.
Because of all these things, Stockholm will always have a special place in my heart.
